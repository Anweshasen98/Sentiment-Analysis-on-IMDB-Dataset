# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-Dataset
The dataset was sourced from https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ and subsequently underwent preprocessing, consolidating both positive and negative reviews into a single file for training and testing purposes. This consolidation likely involved organizing the data in a format conducive to machine learning algorithms, enabling streamlined analysis and evaluation. By merging the positive and negative reviews, the dataset becomes a comprehensive resource for sentiment analysis tasks, facilitating the development and testing of models designed to understand and classify textual sentiment.
